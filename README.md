📌 Aim
The aim of this experiment is to understand the concept of sets in Python and to study their properties.
The experiment also focuses on performing basic operations on sets such as creation, adding elements, removing elements, and observing the behavior of duplicate values.

📖 Theory
In Python, a set is a built-in data structure used to store a collection of elements. Sets are unordered, mutable, and do not allow duplicate values. This means that even if duplicate elements are added while creating a set, Python automatically removes them.
Sets can contain elements of different data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Since sets are unordered, elements do not have fixed positions and cannot be accessed using indexing.
Python provides several built-in methods to perform operations on sets.
The add() method is used to insert a new element into a set.
The remove() method is used to delete a specified element from the set.
Sets are widely used in programming when uniqueness of elements is important and when fast membership testing is required.

🧠 Algorithm
Start the program.
Create a set containing string elements and display the set.
Create another set with mixed data types and observe how duplicate values are automatically removed.
Create a third set to further demonstrate the uniqueness property of sets.
Use the add() method to insert a new element into one of the sets.
Display the set after adding the element.
Use the remove() method to delete an element from the set.
Display the set after removing the element.
Stop the program.

✅ Conclusion
From this experiment, it is concluded that sets in Python store only unique elements and do not maintain any specific order.
The experiment also shows that sets can hold mixed data types and allow dynamic modification using methods like add() and remove(). Therefore, sets are very useful in situations where duplicate data must be avoided and efficient data handling is required.
